We propose CogChain, a **co**gnitive **chain**-of-thought (CoT) reasoning framework that mimics a human supporter‚Äôs cognitive process for emotional support conversation. Specifically, CogChain employs a chained structure to analyze the seeker‚Äôs issues, infer internal thoughts, determine behavioral intentions, and select appropriate strategies to achieve support goals.
